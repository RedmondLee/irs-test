1、本科阶段
（1）阐述一下学术研究中英语的重要性Could you illustrate the importance of English study in academic research?
我认为英语在学术研究中具有重要作用，可以从三个角度看到英语的作用。首先，熟练应用英语是全面了解一个专题、一个项目甚至是一个学科在世界范围内发展现状所必不可少的能力。因为世界顶级的数据库和期刊网内容一般都是以英语为语言载体的，浏览国外网站等也需要具备英语能力。第二，具备英语读写能力是成功撰写一篇学术论文的前提。因为要进行某一项课题的研究必须了解该领域的国内外研究综述。第三，熟练掌握英语还是参加学术交流所必备的能力。因为很多大型的且高质量的会议是全英文交流，如果缺乏英语能力很难了解会议内容以及进行学术交流。综上所述，英语作为一种语言工具在学术研究中是必须要掌握的。
I think English plays an important role in academic research, which can be seen from three perspectives.
First of all, proficient in the application of English is an essential ability to fully understand the current situation of a topic, a project or even a subject in the world. Because the world's top database and journal web content is generally is generally presented in English, browsing foreign websites also need to have English ability.
Second, the ability to read and write English is a prerequisite for the successful writing of an academic paper. Because to carry on a certain topic research must understand the domestic and foreign research summary of this field.
Thirdly, proficiency in English is an essential ability for academic exchanges. Because many large and high-quality meetings are conducted in English, it is difficult to understand the content of the meeting and conduct academic exchanges without English skills.
To sum up, English, as a language tool, must be mastered in academic research.
（2）Have you enjoyed your undergraduate study? 你喜欢你的本科学习嘛
我很喜欢我的本科学习。因为档案学虽然是一个相对比较小众的专业，但是却有丰富而精彩的内容可以供我们学习。本科阶段，我所在的的班级是一个非常有活力的班级，我们的课程总是很精彩。我学习了档案管理、电子文件管理、档案数字化等内容，对档案学有了清晰的了解和更深的热爱。除了理论课程，我们还实地去参观了一些档案馆，有企业档案馆和综合档案馆，这些经历都非常有趣，也让我对档案工作情况有了更深的了解。我还选修了一些非常有趣的课程，如急救常识、排球课和中医养生课程。总之，我很喜欢我的本科学习，我认为它是充实而精彩的。
I like my undergraduate study very much. Because although archival science is a relatively niche major, but there are rich and wonderful content for us to learn. During the undergraduate period, the class I was in was very dynamic, and our courses were always wonderful. I have learned archival management, electronic document management, archives digitization and other contents, and have a clear understanding of archival science and a deeper love for it. In addition to the theoretical courses, we also went to visit some archives, including corporate archives and general archives. These experiences were very interesting, which made me understand the process of archives management, the equipment of archives storage and the means of archives management. I also took some very interesting elective courses, such as first aid, volleyball and Chinese medicine health care courses. In a word, I like my undergraduate study very much, I think it is full and wonderful.

（3）What are the courses that you are strong interested in? 最感兴趣的课程是什么？
We had a variety of courses in the last 3 years, such as Introduction to Archives Science, History of Archives Science in China, Electronic Records and Archives Management, and so on. However, Management of Archives is my favorite course. First of all, this course describes the specific aspects of archive management. Through this course, I have a more intuitive and clear understanding of archives management, which also lays a foundation for my study. In addition, during the study of this course, the teacher also took us to visit some archives to experience the real archive management environment. In this process, I understand the process of archives management, the equipment of archives warehouse and the means of archives management. All in all, the course is practical and interesting. In addition, I am also interested in the management of electronic documents, because the management of electronic documents has been very common, it is very meaningful to study this course.
（4）What do you think of your undergraduate study? Is there something impressed you deeply?你认为你本科学习情况如何？印象深刻的事、比较有意思的事情
我认为我的本科学习是充实而快乐的。首先，本科阶段，我所在的的班级是一个非常有活力的班级，我们的课程总是很精彩。我学习了档案管理、电子文件管理、档案数字化等内容，对档案学有了清晰的了解和更深的热爱。除了理论课程，我还选修了一些非常有趣的课程，如急救常识、排球课和中医养生课程。第二，除了学习之外，我还参加了一些实践活动，这也丰富了我的学习生活。我曾经在档案馆实习，在那个过程中体验档案馆工作。我还参加了学生会组织，和同伴们一起为任务而努力。至于印象深刻的事情，应该是我们全班同学一起去档案馆参观学习。这些档案馆包括企业档案馆和综合档案馆，在这里，我们直观地感受到了档案管理的流程和具体环节，参观了档案库房的装置，了解了他们提供利用的方式。这些经历非常有趣，不仅让我对档案工作情况有了更深的了解，也让我更加热爱档案学。
I think my undergraduate study is full and happy. First of all, during the undergraduate period, the class I was in was very dynamic, and our courses were always wonderful. I have learned archival management, electronic document management, archives digitization and other contents, and have a clear understanding of archival science and a deeper love for it. In addition to the theoretical courses, I also took some very interesting elective courses, such as first aid, volleyball and Chinese medicine health care courses. Second, in addition to study, I also took part in some practical activities, which also enriched my study life. For example, I had an internship in the archives. And in that process experienced the archival work. I also participated in the organization of the student union and worked hard for the task together with my peers. What impressed me most was that my whole class went to the archives to visit and study together. These archives include corporate archives and comprehensive archives. Here, we intuitively felt the process and specific links of archives management, visited the equipment of archives storage, and learned the ways they provide utilization. These experiences are very interesting, not only let me have a deeper understanding of archival work, but also let me love archival science more.
（6）对本科生教育手段的建议Suggestions on the means of undergraduate education
首先，可以进行线上和线下相结合的教学方式，比如说混合式教学。因为现在网络上有许多优质的学习资源，好好利用将带来巨大收益。第二，增强学校和企业的合作，提高学生的实践技能。当前的学生有一个普遍的问题，那就是缺乏实践技能，这不利于他们的成长进步。特别是像档案学这种实践性比较强的学科，更应该增加实践教学的比重。这不仅能让学生感受真实的实践环节，还能增强他们的学习兴趣和学习能力。第三，可以通过一些比赛和活动来提高学生的创新能力。比如说档案学专业的课外科技作品竞赛就涌现出了很多优秀的作品。最后，可以让学生更多地参与到教学活动中去，让他们不仅仅是聆听者，更是发言者。
我为档案学专业的课外科技作品竞赛努力过，我们的作品是档案馆的火灾防控装备，主要通过烟雾传感器来进行自动报警、自动灭火等。但是因为我们的作品还有许多不成熟之处，最终没有继续参赛，不过这对我来说也是一个难得的经历。
除了档案学专业的学生，还有一些其他专业的学生。我们主要是做了一个设计图并讲述了它的原理，因为缺乏防火的专业知识，实物没有做出来。
First, online and offline teaching methods can be combined, such as hybrid teaching. Because now there are many high quality learning resources on the Internet, good use will bring great benefits. Second, strengthen the cooperation between schools and enterprises to improve students' practical skills.  common problem among current students is their lack of practical skills, which is detrimental to their growth and progress.  like archives science this kind of practical strong discipline, should increase the proportion of practice teaching. This will not only make students feel the real practice, but also enhance their interest and learning ability. Third, some competitions and activities can be held to improve students' ability to innovate. For example, many excellent works have emerged in the extracurricular science and technology works competition of archival science. Finally, students can be more involved in teaching activities, so that they are not only listeners, but also speakers.
I have worked hard for the extracurricular science and technology works competition of archives major. Our works are fire prevention and control equipment of archives, mainly through smoke sensors to carry out automatic alarm and fire extinguishing. However, due to many immature aspects of our work, we did not continue to participate in the competition, but it was also a rare experience for me.
In addition to archival students, there are students from other majors. We mainly made a design drawing and explained the principle of it, but the material object was not made due to the lack of professional knowledge of fire prevention.
（7）谈谈你们学校有趣的事儿Tell me something interesting about your school
至于我们学校比较有趣的事情，我们学校每年会有一个荧光夜跑活动。参加活动的同学会在夜晚穿着荧光色的衣服，戴着一些会发光的电子装饰。他们会从一个起点出发，一起跑步经过学校的五个代表性建筑，最终回到终点。在每一个代表性建筑的地方，会有工作人员准备一些小礼品。这个活动每年都有许多同学参与。大家一起在夜晚奔跑，不仅能够释放压力，还能找到志同道合的好朋友。每次参加这个活动，我都能感受到当代大学生的热情和活力，我很喜欢这种活动。
As for the interesting things in our school, there is a fluorescent night run in our school every year. Students at the event will wear fluorescent colored clothes at night and some electronic decorations that will glow. They will start from the same starting point and run past the five representative buildings of the school before returning to the finish line. At each representative building, a staff member prepares small gifts. Many students participate in this activity every year. Running together at night can not only release the pressure, but also find like-minded friends. Every time I participate in this activity, I can feel the enthusiasm and vitality of contemporary college students. I like this activity very much.
（8）评价你的大学生活Evaluate your college life
I think my undergraduate study is full and happy. First of all, during the undergraduate period, the class I was in was very dynamic, and our courses were always wonderful. I have learned archival management, electronic document management, archives digitization and other contents, and have a clear understanding of archival science and a deeper love for it. In addition to the theoretical courses, I also took some very interesting elective courses, such as first aid, volleyball and Health care course of traditional Chinese medicine. Second, in addition to study, I also took part in some practical activities, which also enriched my college life. For example, I had an internship in the archives. And in that process experienced the archival work. I also participated in the organization of the student union and worked hard for the task together with my peers.
Third, I have a group of lovely partners during the university, we study together, participate in activities together. They bring me a lot of happiness and affection. In a word, I like my college life very much, I think it is full and happy.

（9）Please evaluate your English level during the undergraduate stage.
大学期间，我一直在学习英语，通过了英语四级和英语六级考试，获得了全国大学生英语竞赛C类三等奖。在准备研究生考试这段过程中，我的英语读写能力有了比较大的进步，特别是英语的阅读速度与阅读能力得到了提高。目前，我可以熟练的阅读英文文献。但是，我的英语交流能力还是有所欠缺，我也一直通过练习来提升自己的口语能力，希望通过坚持练习能让我的英语口语能力得到提升。
During college, our teachers often stressed the importance of English to us, so I have been learning English. I passed cet-4 and cet-6, and won the third prize of class C in the national English competition for college students. In the process of preparing for the postgraduate examination, my English reading and writing ability has made great progress, especially my reading speed and reading ability. At present, I can read English literature skillfully. However, my English communication ability is still lacking. I have been practicing to improve my oral English, hoping to improve my oral English by practicing.
Imitate the pronunciation of some English apps, and read English materials every day.
2、个人情况
（1）What do you like to do in your spare time? Do you have any hobbies? 兴趣爱好
在我空闲的时候我比较喜欢读书、旅游和慢跑。首先，我喜欢阅读一些期刊文献等来丰富自己的专业知识，同时了解最新的学术动态。这个过程会让我感受到不同思想的碰撞，以及体会严密的逻辑体系。其次，在假期，我喜欢去旅游，感受不同地区的风俗，欣赏不同的风景。我认为旅游是一个可以让人成长的过程，因为在旅游的过程中，我们会学会观察，学会思考。除此之外，我平时喜欢慢跑，特别是在我压力比较大的时候。在慢跑的过程中，我会感觉非常的放松，我的内心会变的平静。
In my free time, I like reading, traveling and jogging. First of all, I like to read some periodicals and literature to enrich my professional knowledge and understand the latest academic trends. This process will make me feel the collision of different ideas and understand the strict logical system. Secondly, during the holidays, I like to travel, to feel the customs of different regions and enjoy different sceneries. I think tourism is a process that can make people grow up, because in the process of tourism, we will learn to observe, learn to think. Besides, I like jogging in my spare time, especially when I am under great pressure. In the process of jogging, I will feel very relaxed, my heart will become calm.
（2）Could you tell us something interesting about your hometown? 你的家乡、家庭情况
我的家乡在河南安阳。安阳是中国八大古都之一，是国家历史文化名城。安阳有丰富的人文景观和山水风光。安阳殷墟已作为世界文化遗产列入《世界遗产名录》。殷墟出土了大量都城建筑遗址和以甲骨文、青铜器为代表的丰富的文化遗存，系统展现了中国商代晚期辉煌灿烂的青铜文明。中华民族最早使用的文字甲骨文以及世界上最大的青铜器在这里出土问世。安阳还有著名的红旗渠，凝聚了劳动人民智慧的结晶。除了这些以外，安阳还有许多美味的特色小吃。
My hometown is anyang, henan province. Anyang is one of the eight ancient capitals of China and a national historical and cultural city. Anyang has rich cultural landscape. Yin ruins in anyang has been listed on the world heritage list as a world cultural heritage. Yin ruins unearthed a large number of capital architectural sites and rich cultural relics, systematically showing the brilliant bronze civilization in the late Shang Dynasty. The oracle bone inscriptions, the earliest characters used by the Chinese nation, were unearthed here. Anyang also has the famous Red Flag Canal, which embodies the wisdom of the working people. In addition to these, Anyang has many delicious special snacks.
（3）Could you give us a brief introduction to one of your favorite book or paper? 最喜欢的一本书/=你最近读的一本书？
我最喜欢的一本专业书籍是胡鸿杰老师的《化腐朽为神奇——中国档案学评析》。这是一本能够为读者带来惊喜与思考的专著。书中处处体现着管理学思想与档案学学科本身的融会贯通，并全面展示了中国档案学基础理论的研究成果。这本书结构清晰，从理性的评判中，将一种全新的中国档案学理念与模式向读者淋漓尽致地展现出来。通过阅读这本书，我对中国档案学的发展历史有了更加清晰的理解。另外，这本书的结构清晰，论证严谨，训练了我的学术思维，让我认识到了严谨与逻辑的重要性。
我最喜欢的书是柴静的《看见》。这本书是作者对自己前半段人生和事业的小总结，书中描述了一个个平凡的人。这本书没有华丽的辞藻，也没有夸张的叙述，真实的讲述以及平凡的故事却更能打动人心。读完这本书，我最大的感受就是每个人都应该思考，思考这个社会，思考自己与他人的社会关系，并保持自己的独立性。唯有深刻地认识事物，才能对人和世界的复杂性有了解和体谅，才有不轻易责难和赞美的思维习惯。总之，这是一本值得深读与思考的书。
One of my favorite professional books is "transforming a lifetime into a lifetime -- an analysis of Chinese archives" by hu hongjie. This is a monograph that can bring readers surprise and reflection. The book is full of the integration of management thoughts and archival science itself, and fully presents the research results of the basic theory of archival science in China. This book has a clear structure and presents a new concept and mode of Chinese archival science to the readers incisively and vividly from the rational judgment. Through reading this book, I have a clearer understanding of the development history of archival science in China. In addition, the book's clear structure and rigorous argumentation trained my academic thinking and made me realize the importance of preciseness and logic.
My favorite book is see by chai jing. This book is the author of the first half of his life and career summary, the book describes an ordinary people. There is no rhetoric, no hyperbole, no telling, no telling, no telling, no telling. After reading this book, my biggest feeling is that everyone should think, think about the society, think about their social relations with others, and maintain their independence. Only with a deep understanding of things, can we have understanding and understanding of the complexity of people and the world, and only then can we have the thinking habit of not easily censure and praise. All in all, this is a book worth reading and thinking about.
	
（4）你最喜欢的一位专业学者和他的一本著作简介A brief introduction to your favorite academic scholars and one of his books
我最喜欢的专业学者是吴宝康老师。吴老师是中国档案学的奠基人，为中国档案学的发展做了非常大的贡献，是一位值得尊敬的学者。吴老师用了大半生的精力和心血开创档案学, 从事档案教育, 开展档案工作, 并见证了新中国档案学兴起、发展和繁荣, 是中国档案界当之无愧的一代宗师。他始终引领中国档案教育和档案学研究的走向，成为新中国档案教育的先锋。吴老师有一本专著，书名为《档案学理论与历史初探》，这本书是吴老师长期从事档案学研究和档案工作的理论积累和经验总结。这本书创造性地提出了档案学的学科属性、研究对象，总结了档案工作中的矛盾与运动规律，提出了以利用为纲的工作方针。通过这本书，我们能看到吴老师对档案学和档案工作的热爱与思考，能看到吴老师严谨认真的研究态度。
My favorite professional scholar is Mr. Wu Baokang. Teacher Wu is the founder of Chinese archival science and has made great contributions to the development of Chinese archival science. 

He is a respectable scholar. Teacher Wu devoted most of his life and effort to create archival science, engage in archival education, carry out archival work, and witnessed the rise, development, and prosperity of archival science in New China. He has always led the trend of archival education and archival research in China, and has become the pioneer of archival education in New China. Mr. Wu has a monograph titled "Investigation of Archival Theory and History". This book is the theoretical accumulation and experience summary of Mr. Wu's long-term research and work in archival science. This book creatively puts forward the academic attributes and research objects of archival science, summarizes the contradictions and movement laws in archival work, and puts forward a working policy based on utilization. Through this book, we can see Teacher Wu's love and thinking of archival science and archival work, as well as Teacher Wu's rigorous and serious research attitude.
（5）有压力怎么排解academic pressure、How to deal with the pressure
当我有压力时，我主要会通过三种方式来排解。第一，在我有压力时我喜欢慢跑，因为我认为慢跑可以释放情绪，让我的内心更加平静。例如，在我备考研究生考试的阶段，我有时会在晚上到操场上慢跑，跑过之后心里会很轻松。第二，在我有压力的时候我会和家人和朋友交流，他们会真诚地给我建议，帮我走出困境。第三，在我有压力的时候，我会通过深度思考和分析来减少压力，这也是对我最有效的方法。具体方式就是：我会分析给我造成压力的源头、分析我的现状、分析我的成绩和不足。然后我会思考我能具体通过什么方式来减轻压力。
When I'm stressed, there are three main ways I deal with it. First, I like jogging when I am under pressure, because I think jogging can release my emotions and make me feel more peaceful. For example, when I was preparing for the postgraduate exam, I sometimes went jogging on the playground in the evening. Second, I will communicate with my family and friends when I am under pressure, they will give me sincere advice and help me out of the difficulty. Thirdly, when I am under pressure, I will reduce the pressure through deep thinking and analysis, which is the most effective method for me. Specifically, I will analyze the source of my stress, analyze my current situation, analyze my achievements and shortcomings. Then I think about specific ways I can reduce stress.
3、考研与规划
（1）说一下自己的研究（学术）规划How will you develop your study plan after you enter in our college?
我认真地思考过研究生期间的学术规划，如果我能顺利考上中国人民大学，我将有以下三个阶段的规划:第一，在正式开学之前，我将拿出更多的时间有计划地多读一些专业书籍以及与之相关的学科论著和方法论经典，积极与导师做好沟通交流，掌握学术基本问题和学术研究前沿，为以后的学习和研究打下基础。第二，第一学年，在加强本专业知识的学习之外，我会加强相关领域知识的拓展，提升自己的科研能力。我会跟随导师进行课题研究，完善自己的研究思路，提升自己的逻辑思考能力。我还会加强英语的练习，为学术研究打下坚实基础。第三，第二学年，我会开始着手论文的撰写，尝试在充足研究的基础上发表论文，并准备毕业论文的撰写工作。然后确定自己的兴趣方向并深入研究，着手申请博士继续深造。
I have seriously thought about the academic planning during my graduate studies. If I can successfully enter the Renmin University, I will have the following three stages of planning: First, before the formal start of school, I will take more time to read more majors Books, master the cutting-edge issues, and lay the foundation for future study and research. Second, in the first academic year, in addition to strengthening the study of this professional knowledge, I will strengthen the expansion of knowledge in related fields and improve my scientific research capabilities. I will follow the instructor to conduct research on the subject, improve my research ideas, and improve my logical thinking ability. I will also strengthen English practice to lay a solid foundation for academic research. Thirdly, in the second academic year, I will start writing a thesis, try to publish the thesis on the basis of sufficient research, and prepare for the writing of the graduation thesis. Then determine the direction of your interests and study in depth, proceed to apply for a doctorate.
（2）What are your professional interests if you are permitted to be a MA student?/ Could you tell us something about your academic interests?
我的专业兴趣是档案利用和档案社会化服务。首先，我认为档案利用是档案工作中非常重要的环节。因为档案的价值能否得到实现，取决于它是否满足了人们的需求。其次，目前档案利用中还存在着诸多问题等待解决。档案学研究者应该重点关注档案服务的方式。通过技术手段创新档案服务的方式，给用户带来更好的利用体验，这也是档案学研究的使命所在。因此，我对档案利用和档案社会化服务很感兴趣。希望通过研究能为档案利用工作尽一分绵薄之力。
My professional interests are archive utilization and archive socialization services. 
First of all, I think the use of archives is a very important part of archives work. Because the value of the archives can be realized depends on whether it meets people's needs.
 Secondly, there are still many problems waiting to be resolved in the use of archives. Archives researchers should focus on the current problems and innovate the way of archival services through technical means, so as to bring users a better use experience, which is also the mission of archival research. 
Therefore, I am very interested in archive utilization and archive socialization services. It is hoped that through research, we can make a small contribution to the archive utilization work.
（3）Could you explain your expectations from your supervisor if you are permitted as a MA student? 
在我的认知里，导师应该是良师益友一样的存在，导师会是一个指引者。我能跟随导师学到的，不仅仅是专业知识，还有更加严谨的思维方式、更加科学的表述方式以及更加开阔的视野。我还希望我的导师能够对我严格要求。因为我认为做学术应该有严谨的风范，这可以为我的学术研究打下坚实的基础。如果可以的话我希望我能做的不仅仅是得到，我希望我能尽自己所能来帮助我的导师，在这个过程中我相信我也能够有所成长。
In my understanding, the mentor should exist as a mentor and a friend, and the mentor will be a guide. What I can learn from my tutor is not only professional knowledge, but also a more rigorous way of thinking, a more scientific way of expression, and a broader perspective. I also hope that my mentor will be strict with me. Because I think that there should be a rigorous style in academics, which can lay a solid foundation for my academic research. If I can, I hope I can do more than just get it. I hope that I can do my best to help my mentor. In the process, I believe I can grow.
（4）Could you explain reasons for you to study in Renmin University of China?
我选择报考中国人民大学继续深造主要有三个方面的原因。第一，我对档案学有浓厚的兴趣，希望通过继续深造来提高自己的学术能力。我认为档案学专业虽然比较小众，但是却有丰富的内容可以供我们学习。而且档案是一种如此宝贵的信息资源，它悠久的魅力吸引着我不断进行研究。第二，我们都知道，中国人民大学是档案学专业教育起始的地方。我国档案学专业的奠基人——吴宝康老师，用了他大半生的精力和心血在这里开创档案学, 从事档案教育, 开展档案工作。因此中国人民大学对档案学人有一种强烈的吸引力，我也希望能在这里受到更加专业的学术熏陶。第三，我很向往北京这座城市，北京作为我国的政治经济文化中心，有它独特的人文魅力。我很希望能在这个城市学习以及生活。
There are three main reasons why I choose to apply for further study in renmin university of China.First, I have a strong interest in archival science and hope to improve my academic ability through further study.In my opinion, although the archival science major is relatively minority, it has abundant contents for us to learn.Moreover, archives are such a valuable information resource that its time-honored charm attracts me to continue my research.Second, as we all know, renmin university of China is the place where the education of archival science began.Wu baokang, the founder of archival science in China, spent most of his life to establish archival science, to engage in archival education and to carry out archival work.Therefore, renmin university of China has a strong attraction for archivists, and I hope to receive more professional academic influence here.Third, I am longing for the city of Beijing. As the political, economic and cultural center of China, Beijing has its unique cultural charm.I really hope to study and live in this city.
（6）你为什么选择继续深造而不是工作Why do you choose to further your study instead of working
我认为在工作与深造之间我还是比较适合深造。这是我在征求众多老师和朋友的意见之后加上自己的深思熟虑做出的选择。第一，作为一个以档案学毕业的本科生，我对于这个专业已有了很深的感情，希望能够在学科发展中做出自己的努力。我认为档案学专业虽然比较小众，但是却有丰富的内容可以供我们学习。而且档案是一种如此宝贵的信息资源，它悠久的魅力吸引着我不断进行研究。第二，一直以来，我对于学术研究有一种特别的敬意，当然我也希望自己有机会从事学术研究。目前我已经在这方面努力，体现在大学期间我就跟随老师一起做项目，写论文，锻炼自己的学术能力。第三，中国人民大学的档案学专业在全国一直独占鳌头，诸位老师是我一直以来所敬佩和钦慕的，我真诚希望在人大能够亲身接受诸位老师的教诲，使我的档案学涯得以继续，并能做出较好的成绩。
I think I am more suitable for further study between work and further study.It was a deliberate choice I made after consulting with many teachers and friends.First, as an undergraduate who graduated in archival science, I have a deep feeling for this major and hope to make my own efforts in the development of the discipline.In my opinion, although the archival science major is relatively minority, it has abundant contents for us to learn.Moreover, archives are such a valuable information resource that its time-honored charm attracts me to continue my research.Secondly, I have always had a special respect for academic research. Of course, I also hope to have the opportunity to engage in academic research. Third, the archives major of Renmin University has always been the top in the country. The teachers I have always admired. I sincerely hope to be able to accept the teachings of the teachers so that my archival academic career can continue and make better Grades.
（7）研究生与本科生的区别？What do you think of the difference between undergraduate study and postgraduate study?
我认为研究生与本科生主要有三点区别。第一，学习内容不同。本科生注重学习基础知识，目的是掌握学科的基础理论。而研究生注重学习研究方法，目的是培养学生独立思考、独立研究的能力。第二，学习程度不同。本科生教育注重培养学生获取知识的广度，涉及的知识往往是方方面面。而进入研究生阶段，必须找准一个方向，注重获取知识的深度。研究生阶段应该把精力围绕一个方向进行，而不能像本科生一样漫无目的的涉猎了。第三，对学习能力的要求不同。本科生教育要求学生接受知识，而研究生阶段要求学生主动研究。即研究生阶段不仅要求学生有学习知识的能力，还要求学生有独立思考的能力、主动创新的能力以及科学严谨的思维能力。
I think there are three main differences between graduate students and undergraduate students.First, the learning content is different.Undergraduate students pay attention to the study of basic knowledge, the purpose is to master the basic theory of the subject.The purpose of postgraduate students is to cultivate their ability of independent thinking and research. Second, the degree of learning is different. Undergraduate education focuses on cultivating students' breadth of knowledge, and the knowledge involved is often in every aspect. To enter the graduate stage, we must find a direction and pay attention to the depth of knowledge. The postgraduate stage should focus on one direction, and not aimlessly like undergraduates. Third, there are different requirements on learning ability.Undergraduate education requires students to accept knowledge, while the graduate stage requires students to take the initiative in research.In other words, graduate students are required not only to have the ability to learn knowledge, but also to have the ability to think independently, to innovate actively and to think scientifically.
（8）所报专业的研究热点Do you understand any hot topics about your profession internationally?或：Pleaseintroduce any progress of your profession in recent years nationally or internationally
根据一项论文研究调查结果，近年来档案学研究热点集中在电子文件管理理论、数字档案资源、知识管理、区块链技术、社会记忆、智慧档案馆、文件价值评估、文件法律理论等方面。国际档案理事会2019年年会的主题为“设计二十一世纪的档案馆”，从这个主题也可以看出国际档案界的关注点。这些研究热点体现了科技引发了档案学理论与实践的变化，科技对档案学发展有巨大的推动力量。

The theme of the 2019 Annual Conference of the International Archives Council is "Designing Archives in the 21st Century"，which also illustrates the concerns of the international archival community.These research hotspots reflect the changes of archival theory and practice caused by science and technology, which has a great driving force for the development of archival science.
If we can have a full understanding of this hotspot issue, we can get the knowledge of the changes in the past period of time. In addition, these dates and theory can help us predict the future trends of archives science.
（10）研究生课程应该有什么？What should a graduate program have?
我认为研究生阶段的课程应该具有两个方面的特征。第一，对专业知识进行深度学习。也就是说，对专业知识不仅要有全面的了解，还应该深入地了解。第二，要紧跟前沿知识，掌握学科的最新知识。我查阅过人民大学档案学专业硕士生的主要课程，有理论信息学、信息资源管理、信息检索前沿研究、档案学理论研究、文件档案计算机管理、中外档案著作选读、企业档案管理、电子文件管理、知识管理、档案价值论、新型信息载体的保护、文献修复技术、文献信息安全技术等。这些课程设置非常全面，紧跟实践发展，有助于培养兼具人文与科学精神的信息管理者。
I think that the graduate course should have two characteristics. First, deep learning of professional knowledge. In other words, not only should we have a comprehensive understanding of professional knowledge, but also an in-depth understanding. Second, we must keep up with the frontier knowledge and master the latest knowledge of the subject.I have reviewed the main courses of the master's degree in archival science of Renmin University ,including theoretical informatics, information resource management, frontier research of information retrieval, theoretical research of archives, selective reading of Chinese and foreign archives, business archive management, electronic records Management, knowledge management, protection of new information carriers, These courses are very comprehensive and closely follow the practical development, which can help to train information managers with both humanistic and scientific spirit.

（5）Could you tell us your understanding about the difference between information management and information resources management? 请谈下信息管理和信息资源管理的区别？
信息资源管理是为确保信息资源的有效利用，以现代信息技术为手段，对信息资源实施计划、预算、组织、分配、协调和控制的一种人类管理活动。
信息管理：是对信息生产，整理，加工，开发，利用等活动的全过程进行管理，对信息技术，信息人员，机构进行组织协调和控制的管理活动，以满足社会需要。
我认为信息管理和信息资源管理的区别主要体现在三个方面。第一，主要研究对象不同。信息管理主要研究社会信息，信息资源管理主要研究信息资源管理活动。第二，管理方式不同。信息管理侧重通过控制信息流来达到目的，而信息资源管理侧重优化各个管理环节来达到管理目标。第三，信息管理包括信息资源管理，信息资源管理是信息管理中的一环。信息管理会经过传统管理、技术管理、信息资源管理和知识管理等环节。
Information resource management is a human management activity to ensure the effective use of information resources and to implement the plan, budget, organization, distribution, coordination and control of information resources by means of modern information technology.
Information management: it is the management of the whole process of information production, sorting, processing, development, utilization and other activities, and the management of the organization, coordination and control of information technology, information personnel and institutions to meet the needs of the society.
In my opinion, the difference between information management and information resource management is mainly reflected in three aspects.First, the main research subjects are different.Information management mainly studies social information and information resource management mainly studies information resource management activities.Second, different management methods.Information management focuses on controlling the information flow to achieve the purpose, while information resource management focuses on optimizing each management link to achieve the management objectives.Thirdly, information management includes information resource management, which is a part of information management.Information management will go through the links of traditional management, technical management, information resource management and knowledge management.
（6）what is the difference between archives management and information management?请谈谈档案管理和信息管理的区别
In my opinion, the differences between archive management and information management are mainly reflected in three aspects: First, The generation time is different. Archives management has a longer history, dating back to the 18th century while information management is a new emerging discipline, with modern computer and communication technology being widely used in various aspects of human information activities. 
Second, Different management contents。Archives management refers to manage historical documents or historical information. However, information management is to control information flow by the means of technology, economy, policy, law and culture.
Third, different management methods.Archives management has a special management process, to go through eight links.There are also specific management theories, such as the source principle.These methods and principles generally do not apply to other types of information management.Of course, information management and file management are also related.Archives are one kind of important information resources. In this sense, archives management is part of information management. 
（7）Your opinion about the access to government information./ Give your opinions on the open of government information?对政务信息公开的看法
在信息时代，政府信息是一种重要的信息资源，具有权威性的特点。政府信息公开是指将行政机关在履行职责过程中制作或者获取的信息，及时、准确地公开发布。政府信息公开有许多作用。第一，它是公众了解政府行为的直接途径，也是公众监督政府行为的重要依据。第二，政务信息公开有利于规范行政权力的正确行使，确保行政权力不被滥用，实现依法行政。因此政府应通过报纸、网站等及时公开政务信息，确保公众的知情权。
In the information age, government information is an important information resource with authoritative characteristics.Government information disclosure refers to the timely and accurate public release of information made or obtained by administrative organs in the course of performing their duties.Government disclosure has many USES.First, it is a direct way for the public to understand the government's behavior and an important basis for the public to supervise the government's behavior.Second, the disclosure of government information is conducive to standardizing the correct exercise of administrative power, ensuring that administrative power is not abused, and realizing administration according to law.Therefore, the government should publicize government affairs information timely through newspapers and websites to ensure the public's right to know.
（8）What do you think the function of records? 
Archives are the original records of people in the social practice, they play a broad role in all aspects of society，It is mainly reflected in the following five aspects:
(1, Administrative function: the archives could help government to make decisions and plans which could improve management efficiency.
(2, Business function : The archives record the operation and development of all walks of life, which is the record of the past business activities and the conditions for the continuation of business activities. (3, cultural function: as a valuable spiritual wealth，Archives are the accumulation of history and culture.
(4, legal function:  The Archives serve as the evidence in legal dispute .They are very  authentic and reliable. 
( 5. Educational function: archives is an important public education materials to citizens.
（9）、What ways you will use to look for information as usual?平常你通过哪些渠道来查找资料？
我平时主要通过三种方式来查找资料。第一，我最喜欢在网络上查找资料。如果是日常生活中的问题，我会查找百度、谷歌这类的搜过引擎。如果是学术性问题，我喜欢通过知网进行搜索。第二，我会在图书馆查找书籍和报纸等材料。图书馆的信息资源内容丰富，但是要找到确切的信息要多花费点时间。第三，我会通过调查等方式来获取一些一手资料，一般用于学术调研。此外，我认为交流也是高效获取信息的一种方法，但是要注意对信息的甄别。
I usually look up information mainly in three ways.First, I like to look up information on the Internet.If it is a problem in daily life, I will search baidu, Google, such as the search engine.If it's an academic question, I like to search through zhiwang.Second, I will look for books and newspapers and other materials in the library.Libraries are rich in information, but it takes a little longer to find the exact information.Thirdly, I will obtain some first-hand information by means of investigation, which is generally used for academic research.In addition, I think communication is also an efficient way to get information, but we should pay attention to the screening of information

（11）Talk about your understanding of the CIO谈谈你对CIO的理解
答： 
2.CIO的职责
（1）规划、制定和实施组织的信息化战略；
（2）为经营管理决策提供有效的信息和信息技术支持；
（3）传播IT理念和建立IT文化
（4）管理信息化团队，维护信息化环境。
CIO is“chief information officer”，the leader of informatization strategy in some corporations. In the information society, CIOs are indispensible and they make very important roles increasingly.
CIO should have a keen ability to capture information, and they should have the ability to synthesize problems and solve them.
The obligations of CIO are follows;
(1) plan, formulate and implement the informatization strategy of the organization;
(2) provide effective information and information technology support for operation and management decisions;
(3) spread Information Technology concepts and establish Information Technology culture
(4) manage the informatization team and maintain the informatization environment.
（12）Talk about your understanding of the CIO怎样理解社会记忆？
因此，社会记忆与我们每一个人相关。我们应该保护社会记忆，保护我们共同的财富。值得一提的是，档案与社会记忆息息相关。因为档案是重构社会记忆的重要工具和途径之一，是建构社会记忆重要且不可替代的要素；然而，档案记录本身并不一定能直接成为记忆，需要经过社会选择、认知和情感认同。Social memory is the memory that is circulated and preserved in a society by various media.
The construction of social memory has profound significance.Firstly, social memory can help us remember our history and help us research our country’s history. Secondly, social memory can be used to improving the strength of our culture and keeping our culture progress. Last but not the least, social memory can contribute to enhancing the sense of national identity, which can promote social harmony and stability. Thus, social memory is relevant to each of us.We should protect the memory of our society and protect our common wealth.It is worth mentioning that archives are closely related to social memory.Because archives is one of the important tools and ways to reconstruct social memory, it is an important and irreplaceable element to construct social memory.However, the archival record itself does not necessarily become memory directly. It needs to go through social selection, cognition and emotional identification. 
（13）Understanding of information management?/ how to manage information?对信息管理的理解？/ 怎样进行信息管理？
信息管理是对信息生产，整理，加工，开发，利用等活动的全过程进行管理，对信息技术，信息人员，机构进行组织协调和控制的管理活动，以满足社会需要。
第一，要用科学的理论进行信息管理。针对不同的信息类型，选用不同的管理理论。比如说，对于档案这类信息，应该以来源原则为指导。
第二，要根据信息类型的变化，不断调整和完善信息管理系统。通过信息管理系统对信息进行规范管理。
第三，在对信息进行整理规范的基础上，要有效地进行信息资源的开发，以更好地发挥信息的价值。
Information management is the management of the whole process of information production, sorting, processing, development, utilization and other activities, and the management of information technology, information personnel, institutions to organize, coordinate and control management activities, in order to meet social needs.
First, information management should be based on scientific theories.According to different information types, different management theories are selected.For example, information such as archives should be guided by the principle of source.
Second, we should constantly adjust and improve the information management system according to the changes of information types.Through the information management system to standardize the management of information.
Thirdly, on the basis of organizing and standardizing information, it is necessary to develop information resources effectively so as to give full play to the value of information.
（14）Features of electronic documents电子文件的特点
电子文件是在处理事务的过程中，通过电子设备形成、办理、传输和存储的数字格式的各种信息记录。
电子文件的技术特点主要有：数字信息的非人工识读性、计算机软硬件系统的依赖性、信息与特定载体之间的易分离性、信息的易变性、信息存储的高密度性、多种信息媒体的可集成性。
电子文件的形成特点主要有：电子文件与形成活动的伴生性、电子文件之间的有机联系性、电子文件种类与状态的多样性。
电子文件的有机联系性是指在产生和处理的过程中所形成的内部相互关系。换句话说，就是电子文件所固有的联系。单份电子文件的价值只有在与相关文件的联系中才得以充分体现。电子文件的有机联系性体现在来源、内容、时间等几个方面。
Electronic documents are all kinds of information records in digital format, which are formed, processed, transmitted and stored by electronic devices in the process of dealing with transactions.
The main technical characteristics of electronic documents are: the non-manual reading of digital information, the dependence of computer software and hardware systems, the easy separation of information from specific carriers, the variability of information, the high density of information storage, and the integration of many kinds of information media.
The main characteristics of the formation of electronic documents are as follows: the concomitant nature of electronic documents and forming activities, the organic connection between electronic documents, and the diversity of the types and states of electronic documents.
The organic connection of electronic documents refers to the internal relationship formed in the process of generation and processing. In other words, it is the inherent connection of electronic documents. The value of a single electronic document can only be fully reflected in the connection with the relevant documents. The organic connection of electronic documents is reflected in several aspects, such as source, content, time and so on.
15）Basic principles of electronic document management电子文件管理的基本原则
电子文件管理的基本原则体现在五个方面：第一，统一管理。统一管理强调电子文件管理规划与制度的协调一致，防止各行其是，互不关联。第二，全程管理。即对电子文件的全过程进行管理，覆盖各个环节。第三，规范标准。这指的是制定统一的规范和标准，对电子文件实现规范化管理。第四，便于利用。文件、档案管理的最终目的是使用，应保证电子文件利用效果的最大化。第五，安全保密。安全保密原则是电子文件管理的基本要求，应实时地对电子文件进行保护。
The basic principle of electronic document management is embodied in five aspects: first, unified management.The unified management emphasizes the coordination of the electronic document management plan and the system to prevent each from acting as his own law and not being related to each other.Second, whole-process management.That is, the whole process of electronic document management, covering every link.Third, normative standards.This refers to the development of uniform norms and standards, the standardized management of electronic documents.Fourth, easy to use.The ultimate purpose of the management of documents and archives is to use them, and the use effect of electronic documents should be maximized.Fifth, security and confidentiality.The principle of security and confidentiality is the basic requirement of electronic document management.
（16）Is email a file?电子邮件是不是档案？
我认为电子邮件是档案的一种。
第一，在理论上，电子邮件符合档案的原始记录性和社会历史性。电子邮件具有内容、背景、结构三要素，还有重要的证据价值、情报价值和文化价值，理应作为档案资源进行处理和保存。
第二，有法律依据。国家档案局的相关文件就要求各部门把电子邮件作为档案来管理了。
第三，在实践上，电子邮件在避免法律诉讼、保护信息资产上重要作用，与档案的价值相符。
综上，我们应该将电子邮件纳入档案管理的范畴。
I think E-mail is a kind of archive.
First, in theory, E-mail conforms to the archives' original record and social history.E-mail has three elements of content, background and structure, as well as important evidence value, intelligence value and cultural value, which should be treated and preserved as archive resources.
Second, there is a legal basis.The relevant documents of the national archives administration require departments to manage e-mails as archives.
Third, in practice, E-mail plays an important role in avoiding lawsuits and protecting information assets, which is consistent with the value of archives.
To sum up, we should include E-mail into the scope of archives management.
（17）What is big data?什么是大数据？
大数据是指：无法在一定时间内用传统数据库软件工具对其内容进行抓取、管理和处理的数据集合。大数据具有 “4V”就是 Variety、Volume、Velocity 及Vitality，即多样性、大容量、高速度及时交性的特点。在信息时代，大数据的应用越发广泛。对大数据进行开发有重要作用。比如说企业可以通过对大数据进行分析，从而做出更加科学的决策。大数据利用越来越成为提高核心竞争力的关键因素。
Big data refers to a data set whose contents cannot be captured, managed and processed by traditional database software tools within a certain period of time.Big data has the characteristics of "4V", which are Variety, Volume, Velocity and Vitality, that is, diversity, large capacity, high speed and timeliness.In the information age, the application of big data is more and more extensive.It plays an important role in the development of big data.For example, enterprises can make more scientific decisions by analyzing big data.The utilization of big data has increasingly become a key factor to improve the core competitiveness.
（18）What are the characteristics and protection methods of digital archives?数字档案的特点和保护方法？
数字档案是以数字形式存在的档案信息资源。与传统档案相比, 数字档案具有以下主要特点: 数字档案信息的可变性、数字档案载体的脆弱性、数字档案信息与载体的相分离性、数字档案对系统的依赖性、数字档案内容传输的网络性、数字档案信息组织形式的网状性。第一、在管理措施上：建立健全档案信息网络安全的法律规范，建立完善数字档案的安全管理制度。第二、在技术措施上，通过防火墙技术、数字加密技术、安全备份技术等进行保护。
Digital file is an archive information resource that exists in digital form.Compared with traditional archives, digital archives have the following main characteristics: the variability of digital archive information, the vulnerability of digital archive carrier, the separation between digital archive information and carrier, the dependence of digital archive on system, the network of digital archive content transmission, and the network of digital archive information organization.First, in the management measures: establish and improve the archive information network security legal norms, establish and improve the digital archive security management system.Second, on the technical measures, through the firewall technology, digital encryption technology, security backup technology for protection.
（19）What is a double system?什么是双套制？
答：双套制是指在纸质环境中，归档文件一式两套，一套移交档案馆，一套由形成单位自己保存。在电子环境中，则是同时保存一份文件的电子版本和纸质版本。双套制融合了纸质文件和电子文件两者的优势，既可以发挥文件的高效存取检索利用功能，又可以保障档案的凭证价值和永久保存的需要。双套制管理也有弊端，它增加了工作量及管理成本，降低了工作效率。而且两套并存,增加了库房占用量,造成库房紧张。在未来，电子文件管理会向单轨制管理转变。
原因：双套制无法保证电子文件的完整性、可用性等特点，这是我们必须走电子文件单轨管理的根本理由。具体来说，第一，电子文件的内容、背景信息、结构三要素只有全程流转于电子系统中才可能真实完整。第二，多种电子文件无法获取纸质版本。第三，单轨制管理才能助力信息化效能，降低成本。
The double system means that in the paper environment, there are two sets of archiving documents, one set is transferred to the archives, the other set is kept by the forming unit.In an electronic environment, both the electronic and paper versions of a document are kept.The double system combines the advantages of paper documents and electronic documents, which can not only give play to the efficient access and retrieval function of documents, but also ensure the value of documents and the need of permanent preservation.Double system management also has disadvantages, it increases the workload and management costs, reduce the work efficiency.And two sets of coexistence, increased the warehouse occupancy, causing warehouse tension.In the future, electronic document management will change to monorail management.
Reason: double system can not guarantee the integrity of electronic documents, availability and other characteristics, or large or small losses are inevitable, which is the fundamental reason we must go electronic documents monorail management.To be specific, firstly, the content, background information and structure of the electronic document can only be true and complete in the electronic version circulating in the electronic system.Second, paper versions of many electronic documents are not available.Third, monorail system management can help information efficiency, reduce costs.

（20）What is knowledge management? The relationship between knowledge management and information management?什么是知识管理？知识管理与信息管理的关系？
知识管理是把知识作为组织的战略资源, 以知识的创造、积累、共享及应用为目标。它共包括四个环节，分别是知识生产管理、知识积累管理、知识交流管理和知识应用管理。知识管理与信息管理的区别体现在：与信息管理相比, 知识管理在管理对象、管理方式以及管理目的上有所拓展、改进和深化。知识管理不再局限于利用片面的信息来满足用户的需求, 而是对用户的需求系统分析, 向用户提供全面、完善的解决方案, 用户可以直接学习这些知识而无需再加工的过程。
二者之间也有联系，体现在：
信息管理是知识管理的基础和重要组成部分，知识管理是对信息管理的扬弃, 知识管理与信息管理能够相互促进。
Knowledge management takes knowledge as the strategic resource of an organization and aims at the creation, accumulation, sharing and application of knowledge.It consists of four parts: knowledge production management, knowledge accumulation management, knowledge exchange management and knowledge application management.The difference between knowledge management and information management is as follows: compared with information management, knowledge management expands, improves and deepens its management objects, management methods and management purposes.Knowledge management is no longer limited to the use of one-sided information to meet the needs of users, but a systematic analysis of the needs of users, to provide users with a comprehensive and perfect solution, users can directly learn the knowledge without reprocessing process.
There is also a connection between the two, reflected in:
Information management is the foundation and important part of knowledge management, knowledge management is the sublation of information management, knowledge management and information management can promote each other.
（21）What standards do you know about archives? Talk about international archival standards你了解哪些有关档案的标准？谈谈国际档案标准
档案工作标准，是以档案工作领域中的重复性的事物和概念为对象而制定的各种标准的总称。它是档案工作中有关单位和个人应当遵守的共同准则和依据。
国际标准ISO15489《信息与文件-文件管理》规定了文件管理的顶层框架, 提出了实现有效文件管理所能产生的作用。它明确规定了文件管理的法规环境要求、文件管理的政策与职责的要求、文件管理的要求、文件管理系统的设计与开发的要求、文件管理过程与控制要求等五个方面。
ISO15489由通用原则和技术报告两部分组成。通用原则是对文件最优化管理的要求的描述，可以为所有国家所接受；技术报告则是文件管理原则的应用指南，它列出了可供选择的文件管理程序和管理方法，各个国家和机构可以根据实际情况有针对性地选用。
总之，该标准为文件的管理提供了一种最优化管理的模式和文件管理的行业规范。
The archival work standard is the general name of the various standards that are made for the object of repetitive things and concepts in the archival work field.It is the common standard and basis that concerned unit and individual should abide by in archives work.
The international standard ISO15489 "information and document - document management" provides the top-level framework of document management and proposes the role of effective document management.It clearly defines five aspects of document management, including the requirements of regulatory environment, the requirements of document management policies and responsibilities, the requirements of document management, the requirements of document management, the requirements of document management system design and development, the requirements of document management process and control.
ISO15489 consists of two parts: general principles and technical reports.General principles are a description of the requirements for optimal management of documents that are acceptable to all countries;The technical report is a guide to the application of the document management principles, which lists alternative document management procedures and management methods that countries and agencies can select according to the actual situation.
In short, the standard provides a model of optimal management and an industry standard for document management.

First, the relevant legal norms are not perfect, to be improved. This affected many links of archives management and utilization. Some management activities are limited by the lack of relevant legal support and protection. Second, the nationwide integrated management system of documents and archives has not been established, which makes it difficult to share and share resources, resulting in repeated construction and waste of some resources. Third, the technical level of some archivists is not high, and their thinking is too conservative. These archivists are unable to use new technologies and systems to manage the archives and provide users with the information they need. Fourth, the information age brings both opportunities and challenges to archives management, such as information security and long-term preservation of electronic archives.
First, speed up the improvement of relevant legal standards to provide strong legal support for archives management. Second, through the establishment of standards, the archives management system more standardized. Third, strengthen the on-the-job personnel training, training archives professional talents. Fourth, accelerate research and development of some key technologies to meet the challenges of the information age.
